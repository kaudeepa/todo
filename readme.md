# To-do List Application
########################
This is my attempt at developing todomvc app with barebone jQuery. I worked on this application (with backbone.js) during a online JS Design Patterns course I took recently.
So, this time I have written in with regular jQuery only, and tried to stick with MVC paradigm as much as possible.
Backend APIs are written in PHP for MySQL db with the help of Slim framework.

I learned some new things while working on this. I was also hubmled by apache configs so got a better understanding of that too, as a side effect!
In all, a great experience! I would love to get your feedback on how I could have made it even better. I am at [dkaushik@outlook.com]

Best,
Deepak

## Objective
Given the supplied HTML and CSS files, develop the backend functionality for a database-backed todo list application.

## Guidelines/Limitations
* Use any backend language you prefer. We use PHP and Node.js, MySQL and MongoDB here, so they would be preferential over other languages and database systems.
* Develop any necessary JS functionality to make the page perform according to behavior specified below. Javascript code may include any JS libraries you like to use. 
* Plain Javascript is also fine.
* The HTML and CSS have been provided for you. While you shouldn't have to modify it to get the application to look correct, feel free to change it to meet your needs.
* The application only needs to be a single page and support one todo list for a single user (no authentication required). Any other functionality is extra credit!

## Base Application Functionality
* On initial load, the todo list should be blank
* Fill out the input field and press enter. 
  * The new entry should be added to the todo list. 
  * Its checkbox should be blank.
  * The input field should be cleared, and placeholder text should be displayed again.
  * Focus should remain in the input field so more todos can be added.
* Clicking on the checkbox next to a todo should visually indicate that the item is completed.
* Todos (and completed states) entered on the page should persist across page reloads.
