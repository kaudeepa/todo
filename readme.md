# To-do List Application
########################
This is my attempt at developing todomvc app with barebone jQuery. I worked on this application (with backbone.js) during an online JS Design Patterns course I took recently.
So, this time I have written this with jQuery only, and tried to stick with MVC paradigm as much as possible.
Backend APIs are written in PHP for MySQL db with the help of Slim framework.

I would love to get your feedback on how I could have made it better. I am at [dkaushik@outlook.com]

Best,
Deepak

## Objective
Given the supplied HTML and CSS files, develop the backend functionality for a database-backed todo list application.

## Base Application Functionality
* On initial load, the todo list should be blank
* Fill out the input field and press enter. 
  * The new entry should be added to the todo list. 
  * Its checkbox should be blank.
  * The input field should be cleared, and placeholder text should be displayed again.
  * Focus should remain in the input field so more todos can be added.
* Clicking on the checkbox next to a todo should visually indicate that the item is completed.
* Todos (and completed states) entered on the page should persist across page reloads.
